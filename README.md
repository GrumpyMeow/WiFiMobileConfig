# WiFiMobileConfig
A silmple webpage to generate profiles for your iphone with WiFi settings. 

Open the following url to activate on your IPhone in Safari: 
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SanderSchutten/WiFiMobileConfig/blob/master/index.html

I've created this web tool to be able to create a WiFi profile for the AP of my car: Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV.
I don't want my IPhone to "AutoJoin" the WiFi connection of my car.
